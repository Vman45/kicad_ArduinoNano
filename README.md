# kicad_ArduinoNano
Arduino Nano libraries for Arduino Nano

In a nutshell: I was working on a small project using an Arduino Nano, and couldn't find a decent Arduino nano library / module for kicad.

So here's my shot at it.  Tested with the standard version packaged for Ubuntu 16.04 and a current download on the Mac.

I assume it will also work on the windows version, it's all the same right? :-)
